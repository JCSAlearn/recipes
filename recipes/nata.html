                <h1>Nata</h1>

                <ul> Ingredients
                 <li>1 cup of flower</li>
                 <li>1/4 salt</li>
                 <li>1 1/2 cup of milk</li>
                 <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
                 <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                 <li>Ready made dough</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>Method</h2>

             <p>Combine sugar, 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water, cinnamon, and lemon zest in a pot. 
                Boil over medium heat, without stirring, until syrup reaches 
                210 to 215 degrees F (100 degrees C). Remove from heat.</p>

             <p>Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.</p>
            
              <p>Whisk flour, salt, and cold milk together very thoroughly in a cold pot. Cook over medium heat, 
                whisking constantly, until milk thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for 
                at least 10 minutes.</p>

              <p>Whisk egg yolks into the cooled milk. Add sugar syrup and vanilla extract. Mix until combined. 
                Strain custard into a glass measuring cup.</p>   
            
             <p>Unwrap the dough and trim any uneven bits on the ends. Score log into 12 even pieces using a knife;
                 cut through.</p>

             <p>Place a piece of dough in each muffin cup. Dip your thumb lightly in some cold water. Press your thumb 
                into the center of the swirl; push dough against the bottom and up the sides of the cup until it reaches 
                least 1/8 inch past the top.</p>
            
             <p>Fill each cup 3/4 of the way with custard.</p>

              <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is browned and bubbly, and the tops start to blister and 
                caramelize, about 12 minutes.</p>

             <p>Cool tarts briefly and serve warm. Enjoy!</p>
